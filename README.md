Recruitment_iOS
===============

iPad app designed to easily collect information from students interested in joining the Sailing Team at UC Irvine.

Used in conjuction with [Recruitment_Backend](https://github.com/SellJamHere/Recruitment_Backend). The information input is stored locally in a persistant Core Data and uploaded to the Google App Engine run backend. In the event of a failed network connection, the stored information is uploaded when the connection is regained.
